# Frontend Mentor - Minimalist portfolio website solution

This is a solution to the [Minimalist portfolio website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/minimalist-portfolio-website-LMy-ZRyiE). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 




## Project Overview

This project is a minimalist portfolio website created to showcase my web development skills. It emphasizes responsive design and dynamic interactivity using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The website uses a mobile-first approach and incorporates CSS Grid for flexible layout management across different screen sizes. Throughout this project, I focused on best practices for modern front-end development, improving performance and ensuring the website is visually appealing and user-friendly on various devices.

## Features

1. Responsive Design (Mobile-First)

	•	The website follows a mobile-first design approach, making sure it looks great on small devices first, and then enhancing the layout for larger screens like tablets and desktops.
	•	Media queries are used to handle breakpoints for tablets (768px) and desktops (1024px), ensuring a smooth transition between devices.
	•	The layout adapts dynamically using CSS Grid to adjust content positioning depending on the screen width.

2. CSS Grid Layout

	•	CSS Grid is used extensively to create flexible and responsive layouts for the main sections, such as the hero section, portfolio projects, and contact form.
	•	The grid structure is designed to easily switch between layouts, with grid-template-areas used to rearrange project sections on larger screens, allowing for different column orders (e.g., reversing image and text in the portfolio section).

3. Interactive JavaScript Features

	•	JavaScript is used to dynamically change image sources based on the current screen size, ensuring that the appropriate image is loaded for mobile, tablet, or desktop devices.
	•	The hamburger menu is implemented for smaller screens, allowing for a collapsible navigation bar. Clicking the menu icon toggles the visibility of the navigation links.
	•	Smooth scrolling functionality is added to buttons such as “Go to About Me” and “Go to Portfolio”, enhancing the user experience.
